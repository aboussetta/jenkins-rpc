## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but please observe the following guidelines:
  * All issues are tracked in [waffle](https://waffle.io/rcbops/u-suk-dev), as per the [rpc-openstack](https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) process.
  * All contributions must be approved by another team member. However each contribution only needs one review; the first reviewer can merge if they approve of the change.
  * Changes must include doc updates if appropriate.
  * Reviewers and developers must be aware that the gate checks against the jenkins-rpc repo are not comprehensive. Code that is not tested by automatic jobs must have manually started test jobs linked in the comments or details of manual tests that were run.
